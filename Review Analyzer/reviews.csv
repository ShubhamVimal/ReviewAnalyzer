"What a waste of time. I am so sorry for all the Thor & Hulk fans. I really am. Movie makers played everyone for fools with all the hype. Lord of the Rings and Avatar remains my all time favorite. My advice to all those who havent watched the movie yet, please do yourself a favor and wait for the DVD. It is highly likely that you will feel wasted like me, so at least you will have saved the money.",Negative

"This is was the greatest viewing experience of a film I have had in a cinema since Jurassic Park came out in 1993. With amazing set designs, incredible character building, action sequences that are perfectly choreographed and three canine actors that are either too badass or too cute to handle. This is one of the, if not, most ambitious films with a flawless execution. A visual masterpiece that shows that Chad Stahelski as an action film director, is a force to be reckoned with.",Positive
Outstanding Action Flick and survival! from the first until the last. John Wick keeps on getting better! The fighting and gun shooting sequence is incredibly perfect! just perfect. The crowd goes wooooah when John just being unstopable. Surely surpass its predecessor. Am planning to watch the 2nd time. Truly remarkable action survival movie. 10/10,Positive
"Hi, I am writing this movie in cinema hall. This is one of the most horrible and stupid movie I have ever seen. Please do not goto see the movie. I cannot even see the movie sitting for 2 hrs.",Negative
I dont understand how Salman did this movie. It was SO BORING that I had to walk out of the cinema hall. I wasted my money. Please guys DO NOT WATCH IT. DO NOT WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS MONEY for this stupid film. DISAPPOINTED AS HELL.,Negative
This movie is another Salman pathetic movie. Poor acting and direction. Tubelight rests on poor plot and lacks the power to enthrall and mesmerize. I am sure it will make money and be declared as blockbuster but this is not worth watching. Only good thing about movie is to see Om Puri,Negative
Complete copy of Hollywood little boy. Pathetic acting n screen play. Torture for audience.Songs r average. How can someone make these kind of movie. Worst movie ever. Story line based on self believe. But after seeing these movie everyone might lose their self believe.Film is very slow nothing happens only a pathetic actor who pretending of a dumb boy always crying.,Negative

"I enjoyed the whole movie. As many of you already know that each characters here are well-known actors and actresses. And each one of them, acted marvelously on their act. I will specially say Letitia Wright was awesome and simply Badass. And it's as usual on MARVEL MOVIES, Best CGI effects...Thumbs up.",Positive
